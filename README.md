🏏 IPL Sports Data Analysis using Python
📌 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Indian Premier League (IPL) match and player data using Python.
The analysis focuses on understanding player performance, team success, and season-wise trends using real IPL datasets.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze IPL match and player CSV datasets

Identify top run scorers

Calculate best strike rates

Compute team win percentages

Visualize season-wise and player-wise performance

Compare player performance across seasons

Export visual summary and key insights

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset is sourced from Kaggle – IPL Ball-by-Ball Dataset.

Files used:

matches.csv – match details such as date, teams, and winner

deliveries.csv – ball-by-ball information including runs and players

🧰 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

📊 Analysis Performed
🔹 Top Run Scorers

Aggregated total runs scored by each batter

Identified the top 10 run scorers using bar charts

🔹 Best Strike Rates

Calculated strike rate using runs per 100 balls

Applied a minimum ball threshold to ensure fair comparison

🔹 Team Win Percentage

Computed team-wise win ratios

Identified teams with the highest winning consistency

🔹 Season-wise Performance

Converted match dates into season (year)

Analyzed total runs scored in each IPL season

🔹 Player Performance Across Seasons

Compared individual player performance year-by-year

Observed consistency, peak seasons, and form variation
